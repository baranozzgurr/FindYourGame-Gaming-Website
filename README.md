# FindYourGame-Gaming-Website
This Project was made for Database Systems Course

FindYourGame is a Interactive Gaming website that aims to bring all gamers into together.Users can have information about the games they want according to the their filters, 
connect to the marketplaces where they can buy the games, and also they can rate the games.
In addition, with the comment system , people will be able to 
comment on the games, and in this way, users see the comments of other people 
who bought a game before buying it.This will create a transparent environment 
for everyone. If a player wants to buy a game, they will be directed to the purchase 
page so they can buy the game they want through us. Again, if users want to share 
their various comments or the games they bought with their friends, Findyourgame will link their 
social media accounts to its system so they can share their activities on their 
personal accounts.In this way, a natural advertisement will be created.
